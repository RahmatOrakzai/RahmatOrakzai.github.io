excerpt: "A simulation and predictive modelling framework for analysing thermal behaviour and cooling efficiency in data centre environments."
---

Modern data centres consume substantial energy, with cooling systems representing a major operational cost. This project developed a **computational modelling and simulation framework** for analysing thermal distribution and airflow dynamics within data centre environments to support energy-efficient infrastructure design and management.

The work integrates thermal modelling, airflow analysis, and predictive algorithms to evaluate cooling strategies and optimise equipment placement.

The study analysed the interaction between computer room air conditioning (CRAC) systems, server racks, and airflow circulation patterns. Mathematical models were developed to represent heat generation, transfer mechanisms, and environmental interactions within the facility.

## Thermal Modelling Framework

A thermal network approach was proposed to model temperature propagation between computing nodes and cooling systems. The framework enables prediction of inlet and outlet temperatures under varying workloads and environmental conditions, supporting intelligent thermal management decisions.

A software simulator was implemented with a graphical user interface to allow users to:

- Configure data centre layouts  
- Model equipment heat generation  
- Analyse cooling efficiency  
- Visualise temperature distributions  
- Predict thermal hotspots  

The system supports decision-making for infrastructure planning and operational optimisation.
