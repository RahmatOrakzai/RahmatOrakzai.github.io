excerpt: "Computer vision and intelligent sensing technologies for unobtrusive monitoring of elderly activity and independence in smart care environments."
---

This research project investigates the development of **artificial intelligence–based activity recognition and smart monitoring systems** to support independent living and healthcare monitoring for elderly populations.

The work integrates computer vision, machine learning, and intelligent sensing technologies to detect behavioural patterns, monitor daily activities, and identify deviations that may indicate health risks or functional decline. The research aims to enable scalable and unobtrusive monitoring solutions for care homes and residential environments.

The project spans both algorithmic research and applied system development, including real-world smart care prototypes and deployment-oriented architectures.
