excerpt: "A computational imaging and machine learning platform for monitoring neurodegenerative disease progression using microwave sensing technologies."
---

This project focuses on the development of non-invasive microwave sensing technologies combined with machine learning algorithms for monitoring structural brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease.

The system integrates electromagnetic modelling, signal processing, and artificial intelligence methods to enable longitudinal assessment of neurodegeneration without the need for expensive or invasive clinical imaging modalities.

The research contributes to early diagnosis and continuous monitoring approaches for neurological conditions and supports the development of scalable digital health technologies.

**Key Technologies:** Microwave imaging, machine learning, biomedical signal processing, computational modelling.
