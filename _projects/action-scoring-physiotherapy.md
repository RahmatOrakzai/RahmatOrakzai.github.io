excerpt: "An AI-driven human pose analysis system for automated movement assessment and rehabilitation feedback developed in collaboration with industry partners."
---




This project investigates the development of an **artificial intelligence-based system for automated movement analysis and feedback** in physical therapy and rehabilitation settings using computer vision and human pose estimation technologies.

The framework extracts body keypoints from video sequences, computes joint angles and temporal motion features, and compares patient movements with reference demonstrations to generate quantitative performance scores. The approach enables objective evaluation of rehabilitation exercises and supports remote therapy delivery without requiring specialised motion capture hardware.

The research contributes to the emerging field of **digital rehabilitation and intelligent healthcare monitoring**, with potential applications in physiotherapy, sports science, and assistive healthcare technologies.
